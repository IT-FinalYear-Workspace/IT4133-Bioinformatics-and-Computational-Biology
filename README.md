## ⚙️ Prerequisites

To run the notebooks locally, ensure you have the following installed:

### 🐍 **1. Python**

- Version: **3.8 or above**
- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 💻 **2. Anaconda / Miniconda (Recommended)**

- Simplifies environment setup and package management
- [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

After installing, create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
conda create -n bioinfo python=3.10
conda activate bioinfo
```

### ☁️ **3. Google Colab (Alternative)**

You can also run all notebooks directly on Google Colab -  
no installation required!
